# Vision

NovelMap exists to reduce the friction of narrative complexity.

Authors routinely juggle:
- Multi-book continuity
- Characters that evolve across volumes
- Plot threads that weave and loop
- Locations, organizations, artifacts, and events that recur

Most tools either:
- demand manual reconstruction (high friction), or
- don't connect manuscript text to metadata (low insight)

NovelMap is different:
- Import-first
- Entity-driven
- Local-first
- Extensible

Not a replacement for writing tools—an explorable Field Guide for the universe you're building.
