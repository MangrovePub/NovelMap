# Roadmap

## v0.1 — Field Guide MVP (Useful Fast)
- Create/open a Project (folder)
- Import manuscript (Markdown first; DOCX next)
- Parse structure: chapters (scenes optional)
- Create Entities (Character/Location/Org/Artifact)
- Create Appearances (manual linking is OK for MVP)
- Field Guide view: dossier + appearance list + jump-to-text

## v0.2 — Relationships + Graph
- Relationship CRUD (typed edges)
- Graph view (filterable)
- Global search
- Basic "continuity hints" (e.g., entity never appears again)

## v0.3 — Timeline + Events
- Event entity type + time metadata
- Timeline view: entity timeline + book timeline
- Simple conflict detection hooks

## v0.4 — Snapshots (Iteration Without Chaos)
- Snapshots (immutable project captures)
- Draft Lines (named snapshot chains)
- Restore + compare (initially structural, later text diff)

## v0.5 — Plugin Ecosystem
- Importers: Scrivener/Plottr (best-effort)
- Exporters: Markdown/HTML/PDF
- Custom entity types and custom views
