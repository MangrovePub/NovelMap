# NovelMap

**Local-first story knowledgebase for series authors.**

NovelMap helps authors import manuscripts, organize narrative metadata (characters, locations, organizations, artifacts, events), and explore it through multiple views—without rebuilding everything by hand.

This project is:
- Import-first
- Entity + relationship driven
- Local-first & portable (SQLite)
- Open-source & extensible (plugins)

## What NovelMap Is
NovelMap is not a writing app. It's a **Field Guide** to your narrative universe:
- Import text
- Declare entities
- Link entities to appearances in the manuscript
- Explore continuity, relationships, and structure through views

## Status
Early stage. Specs are in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Roadmap is in `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Contributing
See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## License
MIT (see `LICENSE`).
